# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Added the AuthContext.tsx file in src/context folder. Thi file is global and should work across all projects

Context Management: AuthContext provides a way to manage authentication state globally in your React app.
User State: It maintains the user’s login state and provides functions for login and logout.
Hooks: The useAuth hook allows you to easily access and manipulate authentication state in any component that consumes the context
Wrap Your App with AuthProvider: In your App.js or main entry point file, wrap your application with the AuthProvider to ensure the context is available throughout your component tree.

# If your user data is already synced with the profiles table, the AuthCallback component may be unnecessary. However, if your app requires a specific step to handle authentication callbacks—such as syncing user data, handling redirects after authentication, or managing sessions—then having an AuthCallback can still be useful.Post-Login Actions: Instead of mixing redirect logic and session management in the login.tsx, you can handle these in AuthCallback.tsx. This helps in managing more complex scenarios, like redirecting based on user roles or specific conditions after a login. Keeping session management and redirection separate from the login logic improves code readability and maintainability. It makes each component’s responsibilities clearer and more focused.If you have complex post-login actions (e.g., data synchronization, multiple redirects based on user role or permissions), AuthCallback.tsx can handle this in a dedicated manner.Consistency: If you have multiple login paths or external login providers (OAuth, SSO), AuthCallback.tsx ensures a consistent way to handle the post-authentication process.By using AuthCallback.tsx, you decouple the redirection logic from the login component. This is particularly useful when you have different redirection needs depending on user roles, permissions, or other conditions.

E.g.
const determineRedirectUrl = (user) => {
// Logic to determine redirect URL based on user data
// For example, based on user roles or permissions
return user.role === "admin" ? "/admin/dashboard" : "/profile";
};

return (

<div>
<h1>Syncing your data...</h1>
<p>Please wait while we sync your data and redirect you to your profile.</p>
</div>
);
};

const fetchUserProfile = async (userId: string) => {
try {
// Fetch user profile from the backend
const { data, error } = await supabase
.from('profiles')
.select('\*')
.eq('id', userId)
.single();

    if (error) throw error;

    // Handle profile data, e.g., update context or local state
    console.log('User profile data:', data);

} catch (error) {
console.error('Error fetching profile:', error);
}
};

export default AuthCallback;

# Prompt for setting up the User Authentication:

Please modify signup.tsx to include the below logic:

-   Register user with Supabase authentication
-   Inform user to check their email for verification
    if (user?.id) {
    // Store additional user information in the 'profiles' table
    const { error: profileError } = await supabase.from('profiles').upsert([
    {
    id: user.id, // Use the user ID from Supabase auth
    username: data.name,
    email: data.email,
    },
    ]);

                  if (profileError) {
                      console.error('Error inserting/updating profile:', profileError);
                      toast.error(`Profile Error: ${profileError.message}`);
                  }
              } else {
                  console.warn('User ID is not available immediately after signup. Skipping profile update.');
              }

apiCore.ts:
This code defines a class APICore that manages API requests using axios, a popular HTTP client, and handles user authentication and token management via jwt-decode. Here's a breakdown of what is happening:

1. Axios Configuration:
   The axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] is set to 'application/json' to ensure that all POST requests use JSON.
   The commented-out config.API_URL suggests that there may be a base URL for API requests, but it's not used in this code snippet.
2. Interceptors:
   axios.interceptors.response is used to intercept API responses.
   It handles errors based on the HTTP status codes:
   403 triggers a redirect to an "access denied" page.
   404 can redirect to a "not found" page (commented out here).
   For other errors, custom messages are returned based on the status code, such as "Invalid credentials" for 401 or "Access Forbidden" for 403.
3. Authorization Management:
   setAuthorization: Adds or removes the Authorization header for API requests, using a JWT token if it's available.
   getUserFromCookie: Retrieves the user from sessionStorage under a key (AUTH_SESSION_KEY), parsing the data if found.
4. APICore Class:
   A service class for making various types of HTTP requests:
   get, getFile, getMultiple: For GET requests, including handling query strings and file downloads.
   create, update, updatePatch, delete: For creating, updating, patching, and deleting resources using POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.
   createWithFile, updateWithFile: Handles file uploads by sending form data instead of JSON.
   isUserAuthenticated: Decodes the JWT token to check if it has expired and returns whether the user is authenticated.
   setLoggedInUser, getLoggedInUser, setUserInSession: Methods for managing user data in the session.
5. JWT Authentication Handling:
   If a user is found in sessionStorage, the JWT token is extracted, and setAuthorization is called to set the authorization header for future requests.
6. Exported Functions:
   APICore is exported as a class to be used in other parts of the application for making API requests.
   setAuthorization is exported for manually setting or clearing the authorization token.
   Potential Use Cases:
   This setup is ideal for managing authenticated API requests where users log in using JWT tokens, and the app interacts with multiple API endpoints.
   The interceptor ensures proper error handling and redirects users appropriately based on the status code.
   Areas to Improve:
   The window.location.href part could be improved by using a more modern routing mechanism if the project uses a framework like React Router.
   Some error handling lacks robust checks, e.g., it assumes error.response.status is always present.

auth.ts:
In this code, APICore is imported to handle API requests. The APICore class, which is defined in ./apiCore, provides various methods for interacting with an API (like create, get, update, etc.). By instantiating APICore, the code leverages these methods to make HTTP requests for user authentication actions like login, logout, signup, and forgot password.

Here's what is happening:
Importing APICore:

APICore is imported from ./apiCore. This class encapsulates API-related logic, allowing the functions here (e.g., login, logout, etc.) to send HTTP requests without needing to directly interact with axios. This promotes cleaner, modular code.
Creating an api instance:

const api = new APICore(); creates an instance of the APICore class, giving access to its methods such as create, get, update, and so on.
Defining Authentication Functions:

Four functions (login, logout, signup, forgotPassword) are defined, each calling the create method from the APICore instance to send POST requests to specific API endpoints.
Explanation of Each Function:
login(params: { email: string; password: string }):

This function takes an object with an email and password as parameters and sends a POST request to the /login/ API endpoint to authenticate the user.
It uses api.create(baseUrl, params) to make the request, where baseUrl is the endpoint (/login/) and params are the user credentials.
logout():

Sends a POST request to the /logout/ endpoint, likely to terminate the user’s session.
It doesn't need any additional data, so an empty object {} is passed as the second argument to api.create().
signup(params: { fullname: string; email: string; password: string }):

This function takes a fullname, email, and password to create a new user account by sending a POST request to the /register/ endpoint.
forgotPassword(params: { email: string }):

Sends a POST request to the /forget-password/ endpoint, with the user’s email passed as the parameter to trigger a password reset flow.
Why APICore is Imported:
Separation of Concerns: By importing APICore, the logic for handling API requests is abstracted away from the authentication functions. This keeps the code cleaner and more maintainable.
Reusable Code: The same instance of APICore can be used across multiple functions to handle different API requests, promoting code reuse.
Consistent Error Handling: The APICore class has built-in error handling (via axios interceptors), ensuring all API calls made through these functions share a consistent approach to managing responses and errors.
Summary:
APICore provides a consistent interface for making HTTP requests, and by importing it, the code here focuses solely on authentication-related API calls (login, logout, signup, forgotPassword), without worrying about low-level request logic.

utils.ts:

This function can be used when you want to allow the user to download a file generated dynamically in the browser. For example, downloading a generated report in CSV format, an image, or a PDF file.

Example Usage:
javascript
Copy code
downloadFile({
data: "Hello, world!",
filename: "example.txt",
mime: "text/plain",
bom: undefined
});
This example downloads a plain text file named example.txt with the content "Hello, world!".

Summary:
The function dynamically creates a Blob (binary large object) from provided data. It generates a URL from the Blob and uses a hidden <a> element to trigger the download.
The function handles browser compatibility and cleans up temporary resources afterward.

useLogin.ts:

This code defines a custom React hook, useLogin, which is used to manage user authentication in a React component. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

Imports:
React Hook (useState): Used to manage component state (user and error).
API Imports:
loginApi: A function for making login requests.
APICore and setAuthorization: Utility functions from the apiCore helper for managing authentication and API interaction.
Key Elements:
State Management:

user: Stores the user information once the login is successful.
error: Stores any error messages or details if the login fails.
API Interaction:

loginApi: A function that makes an API request to log in using the provided email and password.
APICore Instance:

const api = new APICore();: Creates an instance of APICore, which is used to manage various API actions such as setting user information in session storage.
login Function:
Parameters: Takes an object with email and password fields.

API Call:

loginApi({ email, password }): Calls the loginApi function with the email and password. This function returns a promise (i.e., an asynchronous API request).
Handling Success:

On success, then block is executed:
setUser(response.data): The user data from the API response is stored in the user state.
api.setLoggedInUser(response.data): The user data is saved in session storage using the APICore's setLoggedInUser method.
setAuthorization(response.data!['token']): The authorization token from the user data is set in the Axios headers for subsequent API calls.
Handling Errors:

In case of an error, the catch block is triggered, and setError(e) stores the error in the error state.
Hook Return:
The hook returns an array with:

user: The current logged-in user.
error: Any error that occurred during login.
login: The login function that can be used in components to initiate the login process.
Usage:
The useLogin hook can be used in any component that requires login functionality. For example:

jsx
Copy code
function LoginComponent() {
const [user, error, login] = useLogin();

    const handleLogin = () => {
        login({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password' });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
            {user && <div>Welcome, {user.name}</div>}
            {error && <div>Error: {error}</div>}
        </div>
    );

}
Summary:
This useLogin hook abstracts the login functionality for reuse across different components. It manages both the API interaction for logging in and state management for the user and potential errors. It also handles session storage and setting the authorization token for future API requests.

supabaseClient.ts:
The supabaseClient.js file, which sets up the Supabase client, is typically placed in a directory where you store helper utilities or services related to API interactions. Based on your project structure, here are some appropriate locations where this file could go:

Suggested Directory Locations:
/src/helpers/ or /helpers/:

If you already have a helpers directory where API-related code (like apiCore.js) is stored, placing supabaseClient.js there would be consistent.
Example path: src/helpers/supabaseClient.js
/src/services/:

If you have or prefer a services directory to organize external services and API client setups, this would be a good place for the Supabase client.
Example path: src/services/supabaseClient.js
/src/lib/:

If you use a lib folder for utility functions and library configurations, you can place it here.
Example path: src/lib/supabaseClient.js
Usage:
Once the supabaseClient.js is set up in one of these locations, you can import the supabase client wherever needed in your code:

js
Copy code
// Example import in a component or service file
import { supabase } from '../helpers/supabaseClient'; // or '../services/supabaseClient'

// Example usage
const { data, error } = await supabase
.from('table_name')
.select('\*');
This way, you'll keep the client configuration centralized and easily reusable across different parts of your application.

No Need for Separate UserContext:
In this setup:

Session Management: You’re using apiCore.ts to manage user session, authentication, and authorization globally across the app.
Login and Logout Handling: The Login.tsx sets the user session in apiCore, and the Service.tsx retrieves the logged-in user state via apiCore.
Global Access to User State: By leveraging apiCore.ts, any component can check the user session state or handle logouts without needing a separate UserContext.
Conclusion
If apiCore.ts is designed to manage user sessions and tokens, you don’t need a separate UserContext. Just use the provided methods in apiCore.ts to set and retrieve the user session.
Ensure that you store the user session in local storage, cookies, or another persistent place so that it can be accessed across the app, even after a page refresh.
